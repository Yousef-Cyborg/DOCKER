to rebuild the image after each updates:
docker-compose build --no-cache

then run: 





For Dockerized testing:
If you're running the tests inside Docker, ensure you're running it from within the container. You can run the tests for API service and Main service as follows:

For the API service:


docker-compose run api-service pytest tests/test_api.py
For the Main service (Frontend):


docker-compose run main-service  main_service/tests/test_frontend.py
This ensures that Selenium and pytest are executed within the appropriate Docker container.


Running Tests Locally
To run tests locally:

Run API tests:

If you want to run the API service tests using pytest, execute the following:

pytest tests/test_api.py
Run Frontend tests (Selenium):

Ensure that Selenium WebDriver is installed and that you have access to the correct browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome). Then run:

pytest tests/test_frontend.py
This will launch a browser, interact with the UI, and ensure that the frontend functions correctly.
